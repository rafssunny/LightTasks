# LightTasks
A simple software to register daily tasks, with an RPG character customization and skill upgrade system.
I'm using CustomTkinter to build the GUI. The software is currently in development. Right now, you can only register tasks and set the total time required for each one, with a limit of 7 tasks.

## Planned features:
- Allow an unlimited number of tasks
- Enable users to delete individual tasks or all tasks
- Add a progress bar that fills as tasks are completed
- Create a menu with RPG character customization, where users can unlock options by leveling up
- More improvements, bug fixes, and new mechanics
