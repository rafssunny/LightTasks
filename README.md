- New ProgressBar that'll be growing according the tasks are completed.
- New Configuration Menu.
- Now you can creat how much tasks you want.
- Now the tasks have a checkbox.
- Now the create task menu in in the main menu, to more minimalism and optimization.
- Now you can delete all your tasks.
- The time of the tasks are removed.

## Planned features:
- Create a menu with RPG character customization, where users can unlock options by leveling up
- Enable users to delete individual tasks
- More improvements, bug fixes, and new mechanics
